## User Feedback

 After feedback from users, it was evident that a free-flowing, one-page style website would be preferred to allow users to continuously scroll down the website with the next page following on, rather than accessing it through clicking on the page title in the navbar. This style suits a more modern approach, offering a streamlined user experience, where the user can scroll to browse what is included on the website, only stopping to read relevant sections to them. It also improves the user experience as the website would flow more naturally, especially when accessing the website on a mobile phone which, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/ "Statista") is how more than half of website traffic is now accessed.

 This feedback has resulted in updated wireframes and the additional user story:
 * As a user, I would prefer the website to be a one-page, scrollable website.

## Website Goals and Objectives

* Provide information to current students and families.
* Attract prospective students and families to engage with the website.
* Offer useful and accurate information to encourage users to explore the website.
* Give users the option to contact the school through a form with options such as, general enquires, school absences, request a brochure, visit the school, scholarships and bursaries, career opportunities.
* Website should be functional on various devices.

## Wireframes

The original wireframes were designed using templates from [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Balsamiq") which I then sketched the website's layout onto. I started with the mobile version, then tablet and finally the display on a laptop.

[Mobile Wireframes](docs/beckminster-crest-mobile-wireframe.pdf "Mobile Wireframes")

[Tablet Wireframes](docs/beckminster-crest-tablet-wireframe.pdf "Tablet Wireframes")

[Desktop Wireframes](docs/beckminster-crest-laptop-wireframe.pdf "Laptop Wireframes")

User feedback showed a one-page, scrollable wesbite would be preferred, I re-designed the wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Balsamiq") to suit the new requirements. Like with the original wireframes, I designed the mobile version first, followed by the tablet version and lastly the desktop version. This time the process was much easier as I  had more experience with how the website would look and feel from previous designing.

[Updated Mobile Wireframes](docs/updated-mobile-wireframes.pdf "Updated Mobile Wireframes")

[Updated Tablet Wireframes](docs/updated-tablet-wireframes.pdf "Updated Tablet Wireframes")

[Updated Desktop Wireframes](docs/updated-desktop-wireframes.pdf "Updated Laptop Wireframes")

## Design Choices

### Typography

The two chosen font families for the Beckminster Crest website are [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display "Playfair Display") for headings, it has a formal, business like style and is currently used throughout the school already, such as for letter headings. The second chosen font family is [PT Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans "PT Sans"), it is a softer, more rounded font style making it easier to read bigger bodies of text. By using the same font families that the school already uses, it reinforces the brand identity and keeps everything consistent.

### Colour Scheme

The school provided me with their [logo](docs/beckminster-crest-logo.png "logo"), I used similar colours to support brand identity throughout the website. For the website, I took the base colours from the logo and introduced two other colours that complimented the original colours, these offer more contrast, especially for highlighting.

I used [Coolors Scheme](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors Scheme") to select similar colours to the logo and visualise different colours together before making my final selection. 

![Coolors Scheme](docs/beckminster-crest-color-scheme.png)

I then used [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23D7D8D8%0D%0A%231A2C20%0D%0A%237B8175%0D%0A%23CDCDBD%0D%0A%23000000&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to provide the best colour combinations to use for the website to ensure it will be visually appealing and easy to read as well as which combinations are best to be avoided to reduce the possibility of accessibility issues. 

![Contrast Grid](docs/beckminster-crest-contrast-grid.png)

|CSS Name               |HEX          |Use
|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
|   --platinum          |   #d7d8d8   | Light highlight colour                          |
|   --dark-green        |   #1a2c20   | Header and body font colour, navbar and footer |
|                       |             | background colour, buttons                     |
|   --battleship-gray   |   #7b8175   | Highlight colour, button and social media hover|
|   --bone              |   #cdcdbd   | Background colour, secondary text for buttons, |
|                       |             | navbar, footer                                 |
|   --black             |   #000000   | Dark highlight colour                          |

### Images

As the school is an imaginary school, the logo design has been created by [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/ "ChatGPT"). The images used throughout the website are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/ "Unsplash") and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/ "Pexels"), using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/ "Squoosh") to format and resize the images. I will focus on images that are relevant to a school, looking for grand school buildings, green outdoor spaces, formal dress code where required and a more relaxed dress style to demonstrate enrichment activities.

### Videos

The video included is from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/ "Pexels"), it was formatted and resized using [Videobolt](https://videobolt.net/simple-video-tools/resize "Videobolt") to make it a more manageable size for the website. I chose it as it carries on the natural ascetics that I am aiming for throughout the website.

### Responsiveness

The website is responsive to different screen sizes with the breakpoints taken from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/#available-breakpoints "Bootstrap"). There are media queries added to the CSS to determine the correct media query for different viewpoints, establishing a consistent level of user experiences over different devices.

# Deployment

The Beckminster Crest website was deployed on GitHub early on in the development process to highlight any possible issues that could occur. The steps used to deploy the website are as follows:

- Open up the repository on GitHub.
- Select **'Settings'** from the top menu.
- Select **'Pages'** from the menu down the left-hand side.
- Change the **'None'** dropdown menu to **'Main'**.
- Click the **'Save'** button.
- Wait while the website is deployed.
- The website is now live and accessible at: **https://lyd-w.github.io/beckminster-crest/**

Changes can still be made to the website through VS Code, they become live once they have been added, committed and pushed to GitHub. GitHub then lists the different commits that have taken place to show what changes were made and when.
